# **Why did we create this? âœ¨**
Looking back at the creator's origin country about reading often makes me wonder. What's wrong with the reading or literature? 
Why is it so low, and reading have a key impact in the people. Reading have a key impact in the quality of people, with good reading skills and great mindset 
we can make the quality of people higher. This can be achieved by making books more accessible to everyone, that's why I made this system for library to use.
So they can take care of who borrow the books, and the borrower can know when will the book be available for them to rent.

This way, we can make not only my country- but all the world be a better place by increasing the quality of people by the books!
