# **Why did we create this? âœ¨**
Reading or literature skill is a big issue, not just to me, but to the world. Lack of literacy can result in a lot of things, such as civil war because of lack of reading a content and stuff. This is one of the issue the world needs to deal with, books and reading is one of the key to improve the quality of people and can avoid a lot of unnecessary things.

This way, we can make not only my country- but all the world be a better place by increasing the quality of people by the books!
